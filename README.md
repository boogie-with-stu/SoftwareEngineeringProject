## Project Report and Items
The final grade of the project will be evaluated comprehensively based on the completeness of the all submitted items. During and after the project, the following items are expected to be submitted.

## Submit a project report to answer the following questions?
- [] How many members are you in your team? List all team members.
- [] What type of team model is used in the project (chapter 4)?
- []Paste all UML diagrams you used in the project. Some important diagram are expected to be included like architecture    diagram, use case diagram, class diagram, and so forth.

:speech_balloon:
One Presentation in the classroom during the whole semester. Each team leader and members are expected to present your work at the presentation. The presentation will be counted as a partial grade in your final grade.
The presentation: 30% of the final grade of your project.

:speech_balloon:
During the presentation, each teams needs to demonstrate basic operations of LMS system like adding, deleting, inserting, and modifying a record (record could be a course and a student profile), logging in/out system, browsing all records, checking a student or all studentsâ€™ GPA, GitHub demonstration, and so forth.

## Submit all artifacts you used in the project. 
- [] source code
- [] UML diagrams
- [] SPMP
- [x] version control documentation
- [] test cases
- [] data storage files
- [] and other necessary artifacts we studied in the class. 

*For example, if you have used design pattern for software reuse, design pattern document should be uploaded. All artifacts should have two copies, one copy will be uploaded on Blackboard and the second copy exists in GitHub of your team project. The GitHub account is set to be visible for all users so that your GitHub can be accessed for review.*

## Project Peer Assessment
For each project team in the class, evaluate your team members with a grade 1-10 for the performance in the project. 1 represents worst performance and 10 represents best performance during one-semester project.

:speech_balloon:
Your evaluation will not be opened and it will be only used for final course assessment. It is completely anonymous.

:thumbsup:
You can obtain one extra credit in your final grade if you complete this peer assessment. Your evaluation from other team members will not be considered to influence your final project score. Each team member will have the score as the same as your other team members' score related to your team project.

*Note: only assess your team members. Anyone who is not in your team, please do not assess.*

**Peer assessment link will be opened on Blackboard at the end of the semester.**
